## About

Eco Companion is a Tamagotchi-inspired gadget that motivates employees to live more sustainably. Each user has a virtual companion whose “health” reflects their eco-friendly habits—like biking to work or choosing vegetarian meals. The companion’s wellness score is displayed both digitally and physically through a small ESP32-powered device featuring a gauge driven by a stepper motor.

The project combines a Vue.js frontend for user interaction, a Node.js + Express backend with SQLite3 for data storage, and C++ firmware on the ESP32 to control the display and motor. Together, they create a fun, gamified way to encourage greener daily choices.
